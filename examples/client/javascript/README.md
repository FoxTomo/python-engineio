# eio-latency

This is a JavaScript example intended to be used when testing interoperability with Python.

## Running

First, execute:

```
$ npm install
```

Then execute the client:

```
$ node latency_client
```

A connection will be made to `localhost:5000` (if PORT is set in your environment, then it will use that instead).
